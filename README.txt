Automagically show a phone number that is geo-located to be near each visitor - so they are more likely to call you!

== Description ==

Did you know 7 in 10 people won't phone an international or out-of-state phone number?

You're literally ignoring the majority of your global visitors!

This clever plugin works with the [Local Number](https://localnumber.app/) service to geo-locate each visitor and automagically show whichever of your phone numbers is nearest so they are more likely to call you. And even better, you can rent extra numbers in 5 countries - including the USA, Canada, UK and more - to seamlessly forward calls to you.

Once installed and configured, all you will need to do is use the [localnumber] shortcode anywhere in your posts, pages, or templates to have a local number magically appear.

== Installation ==

1. Create an account on [Local Number](https://localnumber.app/signinup) and set up your preferences.
2. Upload the plugin or install it from the plugins gallery then enter your magic tag when prompted.
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress. 
4. Use the shortcode [localnumber] in your posts, pages or templates wherever you want a local phone number to appear.
